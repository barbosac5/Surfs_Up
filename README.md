# Surfs_Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find out more information about temperature data for the months of June and December. This information is needed to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Takeaways from Deliverable 1
-So for Deliverable 1 I was tasked in getting the summary statistics for the month of June in Oahu. When I ran the code and got the output below, the first thing i noticed was that the temperature was not as hot as I thought it would be. Since Oahu is located in the state of Hawaii, and since Hawaii is much closer to the equator (resulting in much warmer temperatures), the max temperature was exactly 85 degrees. I was expecting the max temperature to be much hotter since Hawaii is much closer to the equator than the rest of the United States. 

- In addition when executing the code, the overall stats for the temperatures of June were relatively close to each other. This can be seen in the lower to upper quartiles where the temperatures were all in the 70s and the average temperature for the month of June was around 75 degrees. This means that the majority of the temperatures will be around the 70s and this is only the beginning of the summer months to come. I believe if we ran the July or August temperatures as well, the temperatures will be much hotter which would cause the surf and ice cream shop to thrive.
